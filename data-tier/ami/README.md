## AMI

The AMI for my data tier was just as easy as my user data as I simply created an AMI from my working user data instance, then created a new instance off the AMI and it still worked perfectly.

## Sidenote
As I had already enabled MYSQL I didn't need to add anything to the user data for the instance I created off my AMI.
